A small app that uses graphs and [Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-dijkstras-algorithm-in-javascript-abdfd1702d04) to implement a simple and quick search of the cheapest or fastest path between two destinations where multiple transportation modes are available, such as car, bus or train.
